He has a history of hypertension and smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. His blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg, heart rate is 110/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF."

Immediate intervention, such as reperfusion therapy, is required to prevent further damage to the heart muscle. Stable angina (A) would not cause ST-segment elevation on ECG. GERD (C) and pulmonary embolism (D) do not explain the ECG changes or the specific nature of the chest pain."

Peptic ulcer disease (A) typically presents with epigastric pain unrelated to meals, while gastritis (C) may cause similar symptoms but is less likely without a history of NSAID use or H. pylori infection.

            "The most appropriate treatment is **B. Intravenous thrombolysis (tPA)**. "
            "**Rationale:** The patient's symptoms (slurred speech, right-sided weakness) and imaging findings (CT scan showing no hemorrhage) are consistent with an acute ischemic stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis with tPA is the standard treatment for ischemic stroke if administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. tPA works by dissolving the blood clot, restoring blood flow to the brain, and minimizing long-term damage. Aspirin (A) is used for secondary prevention but is not the first-line treatment in the acute phase. Antihypertensive medication (C) is not indicated unless blood pressure is extremely high, as lowering blood pressure too quickly can worsen brain perfusion. Antibiotics (D) are irrelevant in this context, as there is no evidence of infection."
